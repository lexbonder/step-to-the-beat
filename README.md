# Step to the Beat - Alex Bonder - Mod 3 FE

[Try it out!](http://step-to-the-beat.firebaseapp.com)

## Synopsis

This is my personal project from Mod 3. This app allows a user to enter or calculate their walking running pace (Steps per minute) and recieve a playlist using the Spotify API of songs matching their pace and chosen genre. They can then send that playlist to spotify and begin listening right away.

The project is currently functional but still in it's infancy. There are a few bugs that I am working on fixing as well as improving the UI/UX. I have had many fellow students use the app and I am seeing the common pain points and making changes to adapt.

My Goal for next module is to add React Native and the ability to use the phone's accelerometer to get a more accurate steps per minute.

Stretch goals include having my app actually play the music and give the option update the playlist in real time based on the users changing pace. If the user wants the app to set their pace they can keep in consistent, but I have noticed that a playlist matching my walking pace one day does not match my pace another day. I would like to have the playlist be more dynamic.

## Motivation

During my first two modules at Turing I was also training to run a half marathon at the Rock n Roll Marathon in Tempe, AZ. I always run with music and found that I got tons of extra energy and adrenaline when a song comes on that matched the rhythm of my footsteps. Since I didn't want to wait for Pandora to randomly get a song that matched my rhythm I decided I would make an app that allows me to enter my steps per minute, and get a list of songs that plays at my rhythm.
